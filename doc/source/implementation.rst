The implementation exercise
===========================

The object of the implementation exercise is to gain an understanding
of the finite element method by producing a working one and two
dimensional finite element solver library. Along the way you will have
the opportunity to pick up valuable scientific computing skills in
coding, software engineering and rigorous testing.

There will be no conventional lectures for this part of the
module. Instead, there will be a two hour computer lab session every
week. Some of this time will involve explanations at the board, but
much of the time will be an opportunity to develop your finite element
implementation and receive help on how to do so.

Obtaining the skeleton code
---------------------------

This section assumes you've already done the :ref:`Bitbucket tutorial <bitbucket-git>`.

You'll need your own fork of the finite element repository so that you
can add your implementation. First, `log in to bitbucket
<https://bitbucket.org/account/signin/>`_. Next you can `create a fork
of the repository
<https://bitbucket.org/finiteelement/finite_element_course/fork>`_.

 * **Select** ``This is a private repository`` (this prevents plagiarism)
 * **Unselect** ``Issue tracking`` (all issues should go to the main project)
 * Click ``Fork repository`` to create your own repository.
 * On the right, click on ``Send invitation`` and invite ``David_Ham``
   to your repository. This will ensure that the lecturer can see your
   work to provide help, feedback and marking.
