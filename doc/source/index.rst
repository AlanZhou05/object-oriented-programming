Part 1: Numerical analysis
--------------------------

The theory part of the module will consist of two hours per week
primarily composed of lectures, with occasional tutorials. This part of
the module will be led by `Dr Colin Cotter
<http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/colin.cotter>`_.

The text for this part of the module is Brenner and Scott *The
Mathematical Theory of Finite Element Methods*. Imperial College has
fortunately paid for PDF access to this book, so it is accessible from
the Imperial College network at `Springer Link
<http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-0-387-75934-0>`_.

Problem sheets

* `Examples sheet 1 <_static/FE_examples1.pdf>`_ and
  `answers <_static/FE_examples1_solns.pdf>`_.
* `Examples sheet 2 <_static/FE_examples2.pdf>`_

Part 2: Implementation
----------------------

The implementation part of the module aims to give the students a
deeper understanding of the finite element method through writing
software to solve finite element problems in one and two dimensions.

This part of the module will be taught by `Dr David Ham
<http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/david.ham>`_ in two hours per week
of computer laboratory time.
